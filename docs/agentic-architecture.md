# Agentic Architecture

This document covers how the AI agent actually runs: the harness, memory, MCP tools, and the path from a user message to a streamed response.

For cross-project deployment wiring see [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## No file-based agent project

There is no `agent/` folder and no `agentcore.json`/`harness.json` project. The harness, its memory, and its execution role are declared as literal objects directly in [`web/amplify/backend.ts`](../web/amplify/backend.ts) (`harnessSpecs`, `memorySpecs`), and built into same-stack CDK resources by the `AgentCoreApplication` construct (`web/amplify/constructs/agentCoreApplication.ts`), which wraps the `AgentCoreMemory` / `AgentCoreHarnessRole` primitives from `@aws/agentcore-cdk`. There is no Docker build stage and no `agentcore deploy` step — `ampx sandbox` / `ampx pipeline-deploy` builds everything in one pass.

There is exactly one chat surface (`/chat`) and one agent runtime (`MyHarness`, the AgentCore Harness). The AG-UI handler container that previously served `/chat-handler` has been removed.

---

## Overview

The agent in this project is a **Bedrock AgentCore Harness** — a managed runtime that handles model invocation, memory, and tool execution. The frontend never talks to a model API directly; all inference flows through the harness.

```

---

## Harness

The harness is declared inline as the `harnessSpecs` literal in [`web/amplify/backend.ts`](../web/amplify/backend.ts).

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Model | `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` via Bedrock, converse stream API format |
| Memory | `MyHarnessMemory` (persistent, per-user + per-session) |
| Built-in tools | `agentcore_browser`, `agentcore_code_interpreter` |
| Auth | CUSTOM_JWT — requests carry a Cognito access token as a Bearer header; `discoveryUrl`/`allowedClients` are derived from this deployment's Cognito user pool at synth time (`web/amplify/backend.ts`), not hardcoded anywhere |
| Context truncation | Summarization (preserves 10 most-recent messages, summarizes the rest) |

The harness runs as a hosted container on AgentCore infrastructure. Its ARN is exported via `backend.addOutput({ custom: { agentcore_harness_arn, ... } })` and read from `web/amplify_outputs.json` at build time by the frontend transport layer.

---

## Invocation Flow

### 1. Authentication

The frontend calls `fetchAuthSession()` from `aws-amplify/auth` and sends the Cognito access token as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every harness invoke request (see `bearerFetch()` in `web/lib/agentcore-transport.ts`). The access token is required rather than the ID token because the CUSTOM_JWT authorizer's `allowedClients` check matches against the token's `client_id` claim, which only access tokens carry — ID tokens carry `aud` instead.

The harness uses CUSTOM_JWT auth — it validates the token against the Cognito user pool's discovery URL and checks the client ID against `allowedClients`. `web/amplify/backend.ts` derives both values from `backend.auth.resources.userPool`/`userPoolClient` at synth time (the same pattern `AgentCoreRuntimeWithBuild` uses for the AG-UI runtime), so the harness always authorizes against the Cognito user pool it's actually deployed alongside rather than a value frozen in `harness.json` from a prior deployment.

### 2. Request construction

`web/lib/agentcore-transport.ts` implements the AI SDK `ChatTransport` interface. On each message send it builds the invoke body:

```typescript
{
  runtimeSessionId: string,   // stable per-tab session; stored in sessionStorage
  messages: HarnessMessage[], // conversation history in Bedrock message format
  systemPrompt?: [...],       // from selected Agent's systemPromptText field
  model?: { bedrock: { modelId } }, // from selected Agent's modelId field
  tools?: [                   // from selected Agent's mcpServers
    { type: "remote_mcp", name, config: { remoteMcp: { url, headers? } } },
    ...
  ],
}
```

`systemPrompt` and `model` use the harness's first-class override fields so the harness can apply them correctly rather than injecting them as message content.

### 3. Streaming response

The harness returns a binary AWS event stream (Smithy protocol). `web/lib/aws-event-stream.ts` decodes it frame-by-frame, yielding events:

- `messageStart` — signals the assistant turn has begun
- `contentBlockDelta` — text delta (streamed token by token)
- `contentBlockStop` — signals text block is complete
- `messageStop` — end of turn, includes `stopReason`
- `metadata` — token usage and latency metrics

The transport translates `contentBlockDelta` events into AI SDK `UIMessageChunk` objects, which React renders incrementally via `useChat`.

---

## Memory

`MyHarnessMemory` uses four complementary strategies, all namespaced per user:

| Strategy | Namespace | What it stores |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| `SEMANTIC` | `/users/{actorId}/facts` | Durable facts extracted from conversation (preferences, stated facts) |
| `USER_PREFERENCE` | `/users/{actorId}/preferences` | Behavioral preferences inferred from interactions |
| `SUMMARIZATION` | `/summaries/{actorId}/{sessionId}` | Compressed summaries of old sessions |
| `EPISODIC` | `/episodes/{actorId}/{sessionId}` | Timestamped episode records; reflects to `/episodes/{actorId}` across sessions |

The harness reads relevant memory automatically before each inference call and writes new events after each turn. Memory events expire after 30 days.

### Viewing past sessions

The Amplify Lambda `list-session-messages` queries `ListEvents` on the memory ARN for a given session ID, parses the JSON payloads, and returns them as structured messages. The chat UI calls this on load to restore prior context.

---

## MCP Tools

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools let the agent call external APIs as tools. There are two ways they enter the system.

### Per-request injection (remote_mcp)

When the user selects an agent in the chat UI, the frontend reads the agent's `McpServer` records from AppSync and includes them in the invoke body as `remote_mcp` tool specs:

```typescript
{
  type: "remote_mcp",
  name: "my-tool-server",
  config: {
    remoteMcp: {
      url: "https://...",
      headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer ..." },
    },
  },
}
```

The harness calls the MCP server on demand using these exact credentials. This is the only path for MCP tool configuration — there is no AgentCore Gateway in this deployment; MCP servers connect directly.

### Validating connectivity

Before saving an MCP server, the frontend can call the `listMcpTools` GraphQL query. This Lambda probes the server using the same `url` + `headers` that the harness would use (MCP `initialize` → `tools/list` sequence). If the query succeeds, the harness invocation will too.

---

## Agent Configuration

Agents are stored in DynamoDB via the Amplify `Agent` and `McpServer` models. The chat UI loads them and passes the selected agent's config into every harness invoke:

```
Agent record
  ├── name, slug
  ├── systemPromptText  → injected as systemPrompt override
  ├── modelId           → injected as model override (null = harness default)
  └── mcpServers (via AgentMcpServer join)
        └── McpServer: url, headers[]  → injected as remote_mcp tools
```

Agent configs are applied dynamically at invoke time — no redeployment required when an agent's prompt or tool list changes.

---

## Key ARNs

Exported via `backend.addOutput({ custom: {...} })` in `web/amplify/backend.ts` and read from `web/amplify_outputs.json`:

| Resource | Output key |
|----------|-----|
| Harness | `agentcore_harness_arn` |
| Memory | `agentcore_memory_arn` / `agentcore_memory_id` |

> **Note**: The harness ARN uses the `harness/` resource type, not `runtime/`. These are different resources — the harness ARN is required by the `/harnesses/invoke` endpoint.

See [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md) for the full list of `custom` outputs.
