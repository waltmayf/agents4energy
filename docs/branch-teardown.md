# Branch Teardown

## What's Branch-Scoped

Each branch that runs `pnpm deploy` (`scripts/build.sh`) creates a single branch-scoped stack:

| Stack | Resources | Identifier |
|---|---|---|
| Amplify sandbox root stack | Cognito, AppSync, Lambda, DynamoDB, plus nested `hosting` stack (S3 + CloudFront) | `amplify-web-<slug>-sandbox-<hash>`, deployed with `--identifier <slug>` |

Hosting (S3 + CloudFront) is a **nested stack** inside the sandbox root stack (`backend.createStack('hosting')` in `web/amplify/backend.ts`), not a separately deployed CDK app — deleting the root stack tears down hosting too. The hosting bucket has `autoDeleteObjects: true` (`web/amplify/constructs/hostingConstruct.ts`), so CloudFormation empties it automatically; no manual `aws s3 rm` is needed before deletion.

The AgentCore harness, gateway, and memory (`agent/default/agentcore/`) are **not** branch-scoped — they deploy once to the single target named `default` in `aws-targets.json` and are shared by every branch. Deleting a branch must never tear these down.

## Deleting a Branch's Stack

`.github/workflows-drafts/delete-branch-stack.yml` is a draft workflow that runs on the `delete` event (branch deletion) and tears down the branch-scoped stack above:

1. Resolves the branch slug the same way `scripts/build.sh` does (slashes → dashes, lowercase; names ≤ 14 chars used verbatim so long-lived sandboxes like `main` keep their identifier, else first 8 chars + `-` + first 5 hex chars of the full name's sha1 — 14 chars total; then strip hyphens — matching how `ampx` names the sandbox stack). The hash suffix (applied only to names > 14 chars, the only ones a blind truncate could collide) avoids collisions between branches that share a long common prefix (#400).
2. Looks up the sandbox root stack name via `aws cloudformation list-stacks` (no CDK build/synth needed)
3. Fires `aws cloudformation delete-stack` and returns immediately — it does not wait for the delete to finish

It's kept in `workflows-drafts/` rather than `.github/workflows/` because the Claude GitHub App can't write directly to `.github/workflows/` — copy it over manually to enable it:

```bash
cp .github/workflows-drafts/delete-branch-stack.yml .github/workflows/delete-branch-stack.yml
```

It reuses the same `AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret and `AWS_REGION` variable as `deploy.yml`, and can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` (pass the branch name) to clean up a stack whose branch was already deleted before this workflow existed.

Note: GitHub only fires `delete` events for workflow files that exist on the repository's default branch, so this workflow has no effect until it's merged there.
