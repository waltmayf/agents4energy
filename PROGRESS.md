# Agent Config Runtime — Progress

> **Historical note:** paths below like `agent/default/agentcore/...` reflect the repo layout at the time this work was done. `agent/default/` was deleted in #440 — AgentCore config now lives under `web/amplify/agentcore/` (typed `agentcore.config.ts`, consumed by the `AgentCoreApplication` CDK construct in `web/amplify/backend.ts`). This log is kept as-is for historical accuracy; see [docs/agentcore-cdk-construct.md](docs/agentcore-cdk-construct.md) for the current model.

## Goal

Enable runtime agent configuration so a single deployed AgentCore harness can serve multiple named agents, each with its own system prompt, model override, and MCP server assignments. Users pick an agent from a dropdown in the chat UI.

## What Was Done

### 1. Schema — `web/amplify/data/schemas/agentConfig.schema.ts`
- Added `systemPromptText` field to the `Agent` model so agents can store their system prompt inline (no S3 required for simple cases).
- Existing schema already had `systemPromptS3Key`, `modelId`, `slug`, `enabled`, `McpServer`, `AgentMcpServer`, `AgentSubAgent`.

### 2. Data Layer — `web/amplify/data/resource.ts`
- Added `agentConfigSchema` to the `a.combine([...])` call so the four new models (`Agent`, `McpServer`, `AgentMcpServer`, `AgentSubAgent`) are deployed to AppSync/DynamoDB.

### 3. Transport — `web/lib/agentcore-transport.ts`
- Added `AgentConfig` interface (`agentId`, `systemPromptText`, `modelId`, `mcpServers`).
- `HarnessChatTransport` now accepts a `getAgentConfig` callback.
- Uses the `InvokeHarness` API's first-class `systemPrompt` field (`[{ text }]`) and `model` field (`{ bedrock: { modelId } }`) so the harness handles them properly without message injection.
- When `mcpServers` are present, injects `tools[]` as `remote_mcp` entries with `{ url, headers }` so the harness connects directly to each MCP server for that invocation.

### 4. Chat Session Hook — `web/app/(with-auth)/chat/use-chat-session.ts`
- Tracks `agentId` state sourced from the URL param `?agentId=<id>`.
- On new sessions, writes `agentId` to the `ChatSession` record.
- On existing sessions (page reload), fetches the session's `agentId` from AppSync if not already in URL.
- Exposes `setAgentId()` which updates both state and URL.

### 5. Agent Fetching Hook — `web/app/(with-auth)/chat/use-agents.ts` (new file)
- Queries `Agent.list()` + `AgentMcpServer.list()` + `McpServer.list()` in parallel, then joins them.
- Returns typed `AgentOption[]` including `mcpServers: McpServerInfo[]` per agent (name, url, headers).

### 6. Chat Page — `web/app/(with-auth)/chat/page.tsx`
- Imports `useAgents` and `useChatSession` agentId/setAgentId.
- Passes `getAgentConfig` to `HarnessChatTransport` via a ref (so transport is stable but config is always fresh).
- Renders an agent picker `<PromptInputSelect>` in the footer toolbar. Uses existing `PromptInput*` select sub-components from the design system.
- Picker is hidden when no agents exist in the database (graceful degradation).

### 7. Deployment
- Ran `npx ampx sandbox --once` in `web/` — all four new models deployed successfully.
- Confirmed in `amplify_outputs.json`: `['ChatSession', 'ChatMessage', 'Settings', 'Agent', 'McpServer', 'AgentMcpServer', 'AgentSubAgent']`.

### 8. Sample Agent & Test
- Created `scripts/create-sample-agent.ts` — authenticates via Cognito and calls the GraphQL `createAgent` mutation.
- Created `scripts/invoke-agent.ts` — looks up an agent by slug, injects its system prompt, invokes the harness.
- **Test result**: `invoke-agent.ts demo-agent "What agent are you?"` → `"I am the Demo Agent."` ✅

**Demo Agent record (DynamoDB ID):** `1a92fb1c-440f-455d-954a-80e70b7d7e1c`

### 9. AgentCore Gateway + Interceptor Lambda

Architecture: one deployed `default-gateway` proxies arbitrary 3rd-party MCP servers. Users register servers at runtime via `CreateGatewayTarget` (no CDK redeploy). The web app stores the user's 3rd-party bearer token and can pass it in headers at invoke time.

- **`agent/default/agentcore/agentcore.json`** — Added `default-gateway` with `CUSTOM_JWT` authorizer pointing at the Cognito user pool.
- **`agent/default/agentcore/cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts`** — After deploying the gateway via the L3 `AgentCoreMcp` construct, attaches a REQUEST interceptor Lambda (`UserMcpInterceptor`) that promotes `x-mcp-auth-token` → `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on outbound target calls. Lambda has `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission for `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com`.
- **`scripts/extract-deployment-info.js`** — Reads `UserMcpGatewayArn/Id/Endpoint` CloudFormation outputs and writes them into `web/deployment-info.json` under `gateway`.
- **`web/deployment-info.json`** — Now includes `gateway.gatewayArn`, `gateway.gatewayId`, `gateway.gatewayEndpoint`.
- **`web/amplify/data/schemas/agentConfig.schema.ts`** — Added `gatewayTargetId: a.string()` to `McpServer` model.
- **`web/app/api/mcp/register-target/route.ts`** (new) — `POST /api/mcp/register-target` calls `CreateGatewayTargetCommand` with `targetConfiguration: { mcp: { mcpServer: { endpoint: url } } }` (NO_AUTH; interceptor handles outbound auth). Returns `{ gatewayTargetId }`.

**Gateway:** `default-default-gateway-5qwnlmsqe3`  
**Endpoint:** `https://default-default-gateway-5qwnlmsqe3.gateway.bedrock-agentcore.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mcp`

**MCP server tool injection (current approach):** Transport passes registered MCP servers as `remote_mcp` tools directly in each `InvokeHarness` call. The harness connects directly to each MCP server URL, forwarding any headers configured on the `McpServer` record (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer <token>`). The gateway + interceptor pattern remains available for cases where the harness needs to reach servers through the gateway proxy.

## Known Constraints / Design Decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| System prompt | Passed via `systemPrompt: [{ text }]` in the `InvokeHarness` request body — the proper first-class API field. The harness uses it as the system context without injecting it into the conversation. |
| MCP servers | `AgentMcpServer` table wired end-to-end. `use-agents` fetches the join + server records; transport injects them as `remote_mcp` tools at invoke time. Gateway + interceptor Lambda deployed for proxied/authenticated access. |
| Sub-agents | `AgentSubAgent` table is deployed; the harness does not yet route to sub-agents based on it. |
| Model override | `modelId` is stored on `Agent` but not sent to the harness (harness uses its `harness.json` model). Implementing model override requires either a custom runtime harness or a `configBundle` AB test. |

---

## TODO

- [x] **MCP server wiring**: `use-agents` fetches `AgentMcpServer` + `McpServer` records; transport injects them as `remote_mcp` tools at invoke time. `POST /api/mcp/register-target` registers new servers with the gateway.
- [ ] **Model override**: Implement per-agent model selection — likely requires a custom `bedrock-agentcore` runtime harness (not the managed harness) that reads config from headers/context.
- [ ] **Sub-agent routing**: Wire `AgentSubAgent` records so agents can call each other as sub-agents.
- [ ] **Agent management UI**: Build an admin page (`/agents`) to create/edit/delete `Agent` and `McpServer` records without using GraphQL directly.
- [ ] **Persist session agentId**: When a user changes the agent mid-session, update the `ChatSession.agentId` in AppSync so page reloads restore the same agent.
- [ ] **System prompt via S3**: Implement reading `systemPromptS3Key` as a fallback when `systemPromptText` is absent (requires a Lambda or server action to fetch S3 content).
- [ ] **Multiple agents in one conversation**: Currently the first user message injection strategy means switching agents mid-session isn't clean. Consider a per-message agent field.
