# Invoking the agent

Use `scripts/invoke.ts` to call the deployed AgentCore runtime from the command line:

```
npx tsx scripts/invoke.ts "Your prompt here"
```

- Reads test credentials from `scripts/.env.local` (`TEST_USER_EMAIL` / `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`)
- Authenticates against the Cognito user pool via `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`
- Reads the harness ARN from `web/amplify_outputs.json` (`custom.agentcore_harness_arn`)
- Streams the response to stdout, printing text deltas as they arrive

`scripts/.env.local` is covered by the root `.gitignore` and must never be committed.

# Frontend testing

Whenever you add or modify a frontend feature in `web/`, you must create or update the corresponding Playwright e2e test in `web/e2e/`. See [docs/e2e-testing.md](docs/e2e-testing.md) for conventions and examples.

After creating or updating an e2e test, always run it (`pnpm test:e2e e2e/<feature>.spec.ts` from `web/`) and fix any failures before considering the task done.
